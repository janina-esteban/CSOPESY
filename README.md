## Janina Angela M. Esteban

This program simulates a basic command-line utility that mimics the output of the nvidia-smi command for NVIDIA GPUs. It provides mock information about the GPU, such as its performance, memory usage, and dummy processes. The user can input specific commands to trigger the corresponding outputs or exit the program.

The main entry point of the program is in the file HW4.cpp. The file contains the main() function, which is the starting point for the program's execution. To further specify how to run the code, the instructions below are given.

How to run:
1. Compile the Code: g++ -o HW4 HW4.cpp
2. Run the code: ./HW4.cpp
3. If using Windows use: HW4.exe
